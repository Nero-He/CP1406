<h1 style="text-align: center">Mission Statement</h1>
	<p  style="color: white"> The Training Zone web site is intended to increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Target Audience</h2>
<p style="color: white"> Local residents, mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center" >Success Evaluation</h3>
	<p style="color: white">Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center" >Announcements</h4>
<div style="font-size: 20px">

	<ul>
		<li>For this month only, you can bring a friend to our evening training sessions for half price.</li>
		<li>We now provide a laundry service to current training customers. Ask about it when you book your next session.</li>
		<li>A representative from the Transport orthority will be in our training centre on Friday the 13th to discuss their new training . system, “Perfectrain”</li>
